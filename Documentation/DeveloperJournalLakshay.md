I have been workng on the app for the past 5 hrs
 I worked on various things like fixing the Object classes (Devilery job, Parcel etc) 
 Also made many adjustments to the initial code base - I used several branches to achieve this - I wrote some new code and merged it in a copy of the master- branch before merging into the master , to avoid code loss.
 
 
 - I need to learn about async JAVA and need to do a bit more research into updating in firestore instead of just appending a new record
